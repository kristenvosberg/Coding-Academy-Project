# Coding-Academy-Project
in this course I would like to gain a knowledge of code and computers. My idea is to provude a platform for poeple to play an interactive online game which will promote meaningful, fun, discourse much like the kid i see attempted by strangers on facebook. Ideally the game will operate under the ideas posed by real programs like debate teams, speech teams, and Model UN teams. Would be a blast!
