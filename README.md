# Coding-Academy-Project
in this course I would like to gain a knowledge of code and computers. My idea is to provude a platform for poeple to view their consumption statistics and encourage them to live moderately, but I wont take an aggressive approach. I would like people to have a more annotated and reviewed report of their consumption and to provide them with ideas, althernatives, and encouragement to limit consumption. It will operate as a subscription service.
